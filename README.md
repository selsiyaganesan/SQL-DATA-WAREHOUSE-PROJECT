# SQL Data Warehouse Project – Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver & Gold Layers)

Welcome to the SQL Data Warehouse Project repository.  
This project demonstrates the role of a Data Analyst in working with all three layers of the **Medallion Architecture** data warehouse pipeline:

- **Bronze Layer** – Ingest raw data from multiple sources (**CRM** and **ERP** CSV files) into SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) with minimal transformation.
- **Silver Layer** – Prepare curated, cleaned, and structured datasets.
- **Gold Layer** – Create analytics-ready tables for reporting and business intelligence.

This reflects a scenario where a Data Analyst may handle initial ingestion for basic staging (**Bronze**) and then focus heavily on validation, transformation, modeling, and analysis in **Silver** and **Gold** layers.
